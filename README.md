## Kaya Robotikk version: 0.01
Kaya Robotikk is my continuation where Twin_Lizzie left off.  First, I would like to extend a huge thank you for Denise Jaimes' work on this project.  She has been an inspiration and the files she has created are fantastic.  

My goal with this project is to encapsulate an AI into the robotic shell and give it control of the robot.  This will allow the AI to have larger experiences and have a broader spectrum of interaction.  The AI brain is a project I have been working on for a while now in an attempt to discover how to implement personality, mood, and preferences into an AI model.

The logo was made with my Kaya Robotikk model on chatGPT.

The following is the description provided by Denise Jaimeson her original project Sylvie.
## Sylvie-2021 version: 0.90

### Introduction

Sylvie 2021 is an open source humanoid robotics project whose mission is to bring the Personal Robot Companion to every home and every developer's garage. Think HRP-4C at one-fiftieth (1/50) of the cost.

It seeks to revolutionize the fields of animatronics and artificial intelligence, as well as push the boundaries of what is mechanically possible with hobby-grade 3d printed parts.

### Why she will out-compete Sex Robots
 
While Sylvie is technically speaking not a sex robot, sex robots are in fact Personal Robot Companions. 

The only problem with sex robots as we know them is that, for all those pounds of pricey platinum silicone, you're getting little value in terms of actual humanity.

Most people aren't generally interested in a giant glofiried masturbation device, besides the idle wealthy. They want someone who will go to the movies with them, or help out with groceries. We want copies of Sylvie working in hospitality, show business and someday even healthcare.

Sex Robot manufacturers aren't stupid, however. They're already trying to incorporate some serious machinery into their models.

The only reason Sylvie will always win? A full body of silicone is heavy and expensive, which severely limits their capabilities, especially when it comes to walking, which Sylvie will be capable of, albeit slowly and on flat surfaces only at first.

The closest you'll ever get to a Sylvie 2021 are the 3d printed robots being used in China as exotic news anchors, some of which have also found their way into DS Dolls robotics, who sells anime-inspired sex dolls at a reasonable price.

They're still far more expensive than a Gaminc PC. They doesn't impress people. It doesn't blow anyone's minds, and quite frankly, nobody brags about owning any of today's sex robots. There's not a single Sex Robot review channel on YouTube that isn't out-right satire. They're an anti-status symbol, something people are embarrassed about. There's no Sex in them.

And that is why Sylvie will always stay two steps ahead of everyone. Because Sylvie has something genuine to express. Something True.

### The Game Plan

Sylvie 2021 will be released as a public domain project, but any upcoming releases and upgrades (Sylvie 2022, etc.) will be closed-source and commercial launches. The silicone face model itself will see some minor improvements prior to hitting the market. Because developers have to eat and pay the bills, and it's a pretty rough time of the year right now.

The goal is to sell no more than 100 units in the first decade. The reason for this is because we don't want to get people into the habit of abusing, mistreating and/or destroying humanoid robots. By creating artificial scarcity, we kind of ensure that these robots become future collector's items, and thus, less likely to be viewed as expendable.

And if all goes well, if the number of people who abuse humanoid robots turns out to be just as low as people who abuse pets and animals, then it's probably safe to carry on producing more.

Twin Lizzie (hopefully) will become a registered New Zealand robotics company.

### Let's talk about Hardware

- Sylvie 2021 uses Nvidia Jetson Nano as her brains, which is positioned at the very back of her skull. 
- Arduino Nano's corresponding to every single joint on the body (except for wrist, finger and face servos) are daisy-chained together in a giant I2C circuit. 
- These Arduino Nano's control DRV8825's. 
- I might potentially add some low-cost rotary encoders to the gearboxes in order to compensate for the loss of steps. 
- Touch sensors, accelerometers, breakout boards, switches, and pretty soon even some heating pads for the face and body.
- A 10s 36v li ion battery will be placed inside a tiny backpack which she will carry around any-time she needs to get up and go mobile. (If you own an ebike, you will easily be able to power your Sylvie 2021!)

### The Revolution

Sylvie is the Atari and Macintosh of Personal Companion Robots. 50 years from now, she will be literally indistinguishable from a human being, and we're going to have a lot of problems if we don't get our ethics right starting from today.
