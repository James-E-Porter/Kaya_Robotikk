# Description
Update: Added improved cheekbones. Sharp edges have been blunted so as to avoid pinching the silicone skin and creating unnatural looking indentations when smiling and talking.

Animatronic skull for Sylvie 2021.

Very labour intensive, though I have included a complete model for you to use as a guide.

More info coming up soon.
