# Description
Update: Fixed the thicknesses and screw holes of all mounting brackets. You'll only need 25mm screws to mount the EMC2 mini gearbox. Also added 3d-printable axles to save having to look for proper bolts. You will need to loop a steel wire through the hole at the end of it, or maybe a tiny split pin.

Geared neck mechanism for Sylvie 2021. Loosely inspired by Inmoov, but approaches it in a completely different manner. Designed to be practically indestructible; can withstand significant shaking, such as on public transportation.

More info to come, but practically finished. Complete animatronic head build (v5) with new silicone skin coming very soon.. so stay tuned!
