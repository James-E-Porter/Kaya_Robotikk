# Description
Robot arm for Sylvie 2021. Uses similar concept to the Inmoov robot hand, but makes use of microservos installed in the palm of the hand.

Only the wrist gears were borrowed from Inmoov. Rest was designed from scratch.

The gearboxes for elbow, elbow z-axis and shoulder will come in a separate file.
